MEMORY: decision
✅ Analyzed and stored: This change was made to rebuild user trust by
proactively addressing security concerns about data privacy, as vague assurances
about "only processed content" were insufficient and potentially misleading. The
commit aims to provide full transparency to reassure users about exactly what
data leaves their system versus what remains local, thereby mitigating fears of
unintentional exposure of sensitive information like source code or secrets.

  "enhanced_content": "**Decision Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Summary of Decision  \nThe decision was to implement a change that clearly distinguishes between data processed locally and data transmitted externally, in order to rebuild user trust regarding data privacy and security.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apparent Reasoning  \nBased on the provided context:  \n- **Primary Motivation:** User trust had eroded due to vague or insufficient assurances about what data is processed externally versus kept local.  \n- **Security Concerns:** Users were worried about unintentional exposure of sensitive information (e.g., source code, secrets).  \n- **Proactive Approach:** The change aims to provide full transparency to reassure users and mitigate privacy fears.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Relevant Technical Details  \n- **Scope:** The decision focuses on data handling transparency\u2014clarifying what leaves the user\u2019s system versus what remains local.  \n- **Implementation Implied:** Likely involves UI/UX updates, documentation changes, or logging enhancements to explicitly state data boundaries.  \n- **Memory ID Reference:** `56d24085-209d-4132-b554-b39dcd16f5ce` \u2014 suggests this decision is tracked in a knowledge base or decision log for future context.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Potential Future Considerations  \n- **User Communication:** Ensure that transparency features are easily accessible and understandable to non-technical users.  \n- **Validation:** Consider user feedback or audits to verify that the implemented changes effectively address trust concerns.  \n- **Evolution:** As features or data processing changes, maintain and update these transparency mechanisms to prevent future trust erosion.  \n- **Security Alignment:** Ensure that technical implementation aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The git context provided (`Recent commits: []`, `Modified files: []`) indicates that this decision may be documented ahead of implementation or captured from a non-code source (e.g., design doc, meeting notes).",
