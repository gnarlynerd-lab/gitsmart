  "enhanced_content": "**Decision Summary**  \nThe decision replaces vague \"processed content\" language in the codebase with explicit disclosures about what data is sent externally versus kept locally, addressing privacy concerns and improving security transparency.\n\n**Apparent Reasoning**  \nBased on the context provided, this change appears to be driven by:\n- **Privacy compliance**: Ensuring users are clearly informed about data handling practices.\n- **Security best practices**: Explicit data flow descriptions reduce ambiguity and potential misuse.\n- **User trust**: Transparent communication about what stays local versus what is transmitted externally.\n\n**Relevant Technical Details**  \n- **Scope**: Likely involves UI/UX text, documentation, or configuration files describing data processing.\n- **Impact**: Clearer data handling boundaries, which may affect user consent flows or compliance reporting.\n- **Implementation**: The fix emphasizes specificity\u2014distinguishing between local processing and external transmission.\n\n**Potential Future Considerations**  \n- **Auditability**: Ensure logs or monitoring reflect these explicit data flow distinctions.\n- **Consistency**: Apply similar transparency updates across all modules or services handling user data.\n- **Regulatory alignment**: Verify that the new language meets evolving privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n- **User education**: Consider supplementary tooltips or documentation to explain the updated disclosures.",
