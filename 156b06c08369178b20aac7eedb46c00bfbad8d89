MEMORY: decision
This change was made to rebuild user trust by proactively addressing security concerns about data privacy, as vague assurances about "only processed content" were insufficient and potentially misleading. The commit aims to provide full transparency to reassure users about exactly what data leaves their system versus what remains local, thereby mitigating fears of unintentional exposure of sensitive information like source code or secrets.

  "enhanced_content": "**Decision Summary**  \nThe decision was to implement changes that explicitly clarify what user data is processed externally versus kept locally, replacing previous vague assurances about data handling. This aims to rebuild user trust by addressing security and privacy concerns transparently.\n\n**Apparent Reasoning**  \nBased on the context provided:  \n- The prior approach of stating only that \"content is processed\" was seen as insufficient and potentially misleading, failing to alleviate user concerns about data exposure.  \n- There were likely fears that sensitive information (e.g., source code, secrets) could be unintentionally transmitted externally.  \n- The change is proactive, intended to preempt security-related skepticism and reinforce trust through full transparency.\n\n**Relevant Technical Details**  \n- *Scope*: The decision impacts data handling disclosures, likely involving updates to documentation, UI labels, or system configuration descriptions.  \n- *Focus*: Distinguishing between local data retention and external data processing\u2014critical for compliance and user assurance.  \n- *Implementation*: Although specific modified files aren\u2019t listed, the commit suggests revisions to text/content that defines data flow boundaries.\n\n**Potential Future Considerations**  \n- **Verification**: Users may expect technical verification (e.g., audits, network logs) to confirm that data practices match the stated transparency.  \n- **Updates**: As features evolve, keeping these disclosures accurate and synchronized with actual data flows will be essential.  \n- **Expansion**: Consider extending this transparency model to other areas of the system where data privacy is a concern.  \n- **User Feedback**: Monitor if this change adequately addresses trust issues or if additional measures (e.g., opt-in controls, data encryption details) are needed.",
