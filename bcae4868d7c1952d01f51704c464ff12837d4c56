MEMORY: decision
✅ Analyzed and stored: This change was made to systematically capture
architectural decisions directly within the development workflow, preventing
knowledge loss by ensuring significant changes are documented at the moment they
occur. It aims to automate organizational memory and improve long-term project
maintainability by prompting developers to explain their reasoning.

  "enhanced_content": "**Decision Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Summary of Decision  \nA system has been implemented to automatically capture and store architectural decisions directly within the development workflow. This ensures that significant changes are documented at the time they occur, preventing knowledge loss and improving long-term project maintainability.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apparent Reasoning (Based on Git Context)  \n- **Branch:** `master` \u2013 This decision is integrated into the main development branch, indicating it is a core part of the workflow.  \n- **Recent commits & modified files:** No recent commits or file changes are noted, suggesting this decision may be part of an initial setup or foundational process rather than a recent code change.  \n- **Goal:** To automate organizational memory by prompting developers to explain their reasoning for significant changes, ensuring documentation is not deferred or forgotten.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Relevant Technical Details  \n- **Memory ID:** `9eaf73e1-c5e6-4724-a90b-cdd1501bdf19` \u2013 A unique identifier for this decision, likely used for tracking and retrieval within the system.  \n- **Integration:** The decision is captured systematically within the development workflow, implying possible hooks or triggers (e.g., pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines) to prompt documentation.  \n- **Scope:** Focuses on architectural decisions, suggesting it may target specific types of changes (e.g., design patterns, infrastructure changes, major refactors).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Potential Future Considerations  \n- **Adoption:** Ensure all team members are aware of and consistently use the system to avoid gaps in documentation.  \n- **Tooling:** Consider integrating with existing tools (e.g., ADR libraries, project management software) to streamline the process.  \n- **Maintenance:** Regularly review and update captured decisions to reflect evolving project context or deprecated choices.  \n- **Searchability:** Implement a way to easily search and reference past decisions using the Memory ID or other metadata.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The lack of recent commits or modified files in the context suggests this decision may be part of a broader process or tooling setup rather than a code-level change.",
