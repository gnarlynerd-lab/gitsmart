MEMORY: decision
This change was made to systematically capture architectural decisions directly within the development workflow, preventing knowledge loss by ensuring significant changes are documented at the moment they occur. It aims to automate organizational memory and improve long-term project maintainability by prompting developers to explain their reasoning.

  "enhanced_content": "**Decision Summary**  \nThe decision establishes a process to document architectural decisions directly within the development workflow, ensuring that significant changes are recorded as they happen. This aims to prevent knowledge loss, automate organizational memory, and improve long-term project maintainability by prompting developers to explain their reasoning.\n\n**Apparent Reasoning**  \nBased on the context, this appears to be a foundational or procedural decision rather than a code change. The empty commit and file modification history suggest this may be an initial setup or policy definition, possibly involving:  \n- Introducing a decision-logging framework (e.g., ADRs\u2014Architectural Decision Records).  \n- Integrating documentation steps into version control workflows (e.g., commit hooks, PR templates).  \n- Addressing past issues where undocumented changes led to technical debt or knowledge gaps.\n\n**Relevant Technical Details**  \n- Implementation likely involves:  \n  - A standardized template for decision records (e.g., in Markdown files under `docs/decisions/`).  \n  - Automation triggers (e.g., Git hooks, CI checks) to prompt documentation during key actions like merging to `master`.  \n  - Version-controlled storage of decisions alongside code for traceability.  \n- No direct code modifications are indicated, implying the change is process-oriented.\n\n**Potential Future Considerations**  \n- **Adoption**: Ensure team buy-in and clear guidelines to avoid process overhead.  \n- **Maintenance**: Regularly review and prune outdated decisions to keep the log relevant.  \n- **Tooling**: Consider integrating with issue trackers or wikis for cross-referencing.  \n- **Evolution**: As the project scales, the process may need adjustments (e.g., lightweight vs. detailed records).  \n\nThis decision prioritizes proactive knowledge management, aiming to reduce future friction in understanding system evolution.",
